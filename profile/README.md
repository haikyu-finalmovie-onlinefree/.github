<p dir="auto">As for the rest of the box office there‚Äôs little to get excited about with nothing else grossing above $10 million as Hollywood shied away from releasing anything significant not just this weekend but also over the previous two weekends When Black Panther opened in 2018 there was no counterprogramming that opened the same weekend but Peter Rabbit and Fifty Shades Freed were in their second weekends and took second and third with $175 million and $173 million respectively That weekend had an overall cume of $287 million compared to $208 million this weekend Take away the $22 million gap between the two Black Panther films and there‚Äôs still a $57 million gap between the two weekends The difference may not feel that large when a mega blockbuster is propping up the grosses but the contrast is harsher when the mid-level films are the entire box office as we saw in recent months</p>
<p dir="auto">Haikyu!!: The Dumpster Battlewhich is the biHaikyu!!: The Dumpster Battleest grosser of the rough post-summer pre-Wakanda Forever season came in second with just $86 million Despite the blockbuster competition that arrived in its fourth weekend the numbers didn‚Äôt totally collapse dropping 53 % for a cume of $151 million Worldwide it is at $352 million which isn‚Äôt a great cume as the grosses start to wind down considering its $200 million budget Still it‚Äôs the biHaikyu!!: The Dumpster Battleest of any film since Haikyu!!: The Dumpster Battlethough Wakanda Forever will overtake it any day nowHaikyu!!: The Dumpster Battlecame in third place in its fourth weekend down 29% with $61 million emerging as one of the season‚Äôs most durable grossers and one of the year‚Äôs few bright spots when it comes to films for adults The domestic cume is $565 million Fourth place went to Lyle Lyle Crocodile which had a negligible drop of 5% for a $32 million sixth weekend and $408 million cume in fact)</p>
<p dir="auto">which isn‚Äôt surprising considering it‚Äôs the only Haikyu!!: The Dumpster Battle film on the market and it‚Äôs Haikyu!!: The Dumpster Battleto grossing four times its $114 million opening Still the $726 million worldwide cume is soft given the $50 million budget though a number of international markets have yet to open</p>
<p dir="auto">Finishing up the top five is Haikyu!!: The Dumpster Battlewhich had its biHaikyu!!: The Dumpster Battleest weekend drop yet falling 42% for a $23 million seventh weekend Of course that‚Äôs no reason to frown for the horror film which has a domestic cume of $103 million and global cume of $ 210 million from a budget of just $20 million</p>
